# Intake Kit — Developer Guide

This repo is the source for the `intake-kit` Lola module.
The installable module lives entirely under `./module/`.

## Project layout

```
module/                            ← installable module (what users get)
  AGENTS.md                        ← injected into user's AGENTS.md by lola
  agents/                          ← standalone review agent definitions
  skills/prd-review/
    SKILL.md                       ← orchestration skill
    references/                    ← reviewer protocol and shared refs
  skills/discovery/
    SKILL.md                       ← orchestration skill
    references/discovery-protocol.md  ← shared researcher/gatherer contract
  commands/prd-review.md           ← command entry point
  commands/discovery.md            ← command entry point
prd.cue                            ← CUE schema (published to CUE registry)
cue.mod/                           ← CUE module definition
examples/                          ← example PRD YAML files
.github/workflows/                 ← CI (CUE registry publish)
```

## Golden rule

**All changes to module content go in `./module/`, never in the installed location.**

The installed copy (typically `~/.config/opencode/skills/prd-review/`
or `.claude/skills/prd-review/`) is a deployment artifact. If you find
yourself editing files outside `./module/`, stop — you're modifying a
copy that will be overwritten on next install.

## Working on review agents

Agent definitions live at `module/agents/prd-*.md`. Each is a standalone
reviewer that runs in parallel during Phase 2 of the review council.
Follow the existing agent files as a template when adding new ones.

## Working on discovery agents

Agent definitions live at `module/agents/discovery-*.md`. The researcher
and gatherer run in parallel during Phase 1 of the discovery skill; the
distiller runs in Phase 2. Follow the existing agent files as a template
when adding new ones.

## Working on the schema

The CUE schema at `prd.cue` is published to the CUE Central
Registry via the `publish-cue.yml` workflow on tag push. The module
definition at `cue.mod/module.cue` controls the module path and
language version.

## Tool Agnosticism

This module MUST remain target-tool agnostic. It must work identically
whether the hosting tool is Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Windsurf,
Gemini CLI, or any future AI coding assistant.

Rules:

1. **No tool-specific frontmatter.** Skill and agent files use only
   keys every host understands.
2. **No tool-specific dispatch syntax.** Orchestrator docs describe
   dispatch intent with fallback instructions for hosts that lack
   named-agent dispatch.
3. **No tool names in operational text.** References to specific tools
   are permitted only in docs — never in instructions or agent
   definitions that affect runtime behavior.
4. **Graceful degradation over hard requirements.** Features that
   depend on host capabilities must degrade gracefully when the host
   lacks them, not fail.
