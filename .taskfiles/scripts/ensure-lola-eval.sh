# Bring the lola-eval harness into a managed virtualenv, or confirm the one
# already there is the one the Taskfile asks for.

# Usage: ensure-lola-eval.sh [--force] <binary> <venv-dir> <spec>
#
#   binary    the lola-eval path the Taskfile resolved. When it is not the one
#             inside <venv-dir>, the host already has lola-eval installed and
#             this script keeps its hands off.
#   venv-dir  the virtualenv this script owns outright. It is cleared and
#             rebuilt, never patched, so nothing else may live in it.
#   spec      a PEP 508 direct reference, e.g.
#             'lola-eval @ git+https://host/lola-eval.git@main'
#   --force   rebuild even when the venv already matches <spec>. With a
#             floating ref the spec string never changes, so this is the only
#             way to pick up new upstream commits.
#
# Why a script rather than a `status:` block on the task: Task resolves a
# global `sh:` var when it parses the file, before any dep can run, so the
# Taskfile cannot both discover lola-eval and install it in one invocation.
# The var therefore names a fixed path and this script makes that path real.
# Keeping the create/install/skip/fail decision here also puts it somewhere
# that shellcheck lints and module/tests/test-ensure-lola-eval.sh can drive.
